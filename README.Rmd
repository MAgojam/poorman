## Overview

`{poorman}` is a grammar of data manipulation, providing dependency free versions of [`{dplyr}`](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr) verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges:

* `select()` picks variables based on their names.
* `mutate()` adds new variables that are functions of existing variables.
* `filter()` picks cases based on their values.
* `summarise()` reduces multiple values down to a single summary.
* `arrange()` changes the ordering of the rows.

`{poorman}` attempts to replicate the `{dplyr}` API exactly such that your `{dplyr}` code will still run even if you use `{poorman}` in its place. In addition to replicating `{dplyr}` functionality, `{poorman}` implements other functionality from the wider `tidyverse` such as select helpers and the pipe, `%>%`.

For more details on the functionality available within `{poorman}`, check out the `{poorman}` series of blog posts [here](https://nathaneastwood.github.io/tags/poorman/).

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/nathaneastwood/poorman) with:

```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("nathaneastwood/poorman")
```

Or you can install the latest release from CRAN with:

```{r cran, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("poorman")
```

## Docker

If you'd like to try out the latest version of the package on CRAN using Docker, you can run the latest image with:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
docker run --rm -it nathaneastwood/poorman
```

## Usage

```{r usage}
library(poorman, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

mtcars %>%
  select(mpg, starts_with("c")) %>%
  mutate(mpg2 = mpg * 2, mpg4 = mpg2 * 2) %>%
  filter(mpg > 28)

mtcars %>%
  group_by(am, cyl) %>%
  summarise(meanMpg = mean(mpg), sumMpg = sum(mpg)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

* [`{dplyr}`](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr)
* [`{bplyr}`](https://github.com/yonicd/bplyr) - imports `magrittr` and `rlang`; it prepends functions with `b_*()`, e.g. `b_select()`.
* [`{tbltools}`](https://github.com/mkearney/tbltools) - imports `magrittr` and appends `*_data()` to each of its functions, e.g. `select_data()`.
